### 3.2 Tech Cover Letter Drafting

---

A cover letter in the tech industry should complement your resume by explaining why you’re interested in a specific role and how your skills and experiences align with the company’s needs. It’s an opportunity to show your enthusiasm and fit for the position.

**Key Components:**

1. **Structure:**
   - **Header:** Match the header with your resume for a consistent look.
   - **Greeting:** Address the letter to a specific person if possible (e.g., “Dear Hiring Manager”).
   - **Introduction:** Introduce yourself and explain your interest in the role and the company. Mention how you found the job opening.
   - **Body:**
     - **First Paragraph:** Highlight your most relevant experiences and skills that make you a strong candidate for the role. Tailor this section to the job description.
     - **Second Paragraph:** Explain why you’re interested in the company. Mention specific projects or values that resonate with you.
     - **Third Paragraph:** Discuss how your background will help you contribute to the company’s goals. Be specific about the impact you aim to make.
   - **Conclusion:** Reiterate your enthusiasm for the role and your eagerness to discuss further in an interview. Include a call to action (e.g., “I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team”).
   - **Closing:** Use a professional closing (e.g., “Sincerely”) and include your name.

2. **Tailoring the Cover Letter:**
   - Research the company thoroughly. Mention specific technologies they use or projects they’re involved in.
   - Customize each cover letter to the role you’re applying for. Generic cover letters are easily spotted and often dismissed.

3. **Technical Depth:**
   - Include details on the technical skills you’ve developed that are directly relevant to the role.
   - Explain any projects or roles that required problem-solving or innovation.

4. **Language and Tone:**
   - Be concise and direct. The cover letter should be no longer than one page.
   - Maintain a professional yet enthusiastic tone. Show your passion for the field.

5. **Common Mistakes:**
   - Avoid repeating your resume. Instead, use the cover letter to expand on your most relevant experiences.
   - Don’t use a generic template for every application. Personalization is key.

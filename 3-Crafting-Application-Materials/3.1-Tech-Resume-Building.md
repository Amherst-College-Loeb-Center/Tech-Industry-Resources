### 3.1 Tech Resume Building

---

Building a resume for the tech industry is about showcasing your technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and experience with technologies that align with the roles you’re applying for. Your resume is your first impression, and in a field where competition is fierce, it must stand out.

**Key Components:**

1. **Structure:**
   - **Header:** Include your name, contact information (phone number, email), and a link to your LinkedIn profile and GitHub repository. Mailing addresses are unnecessary.
   - **Education:** List your degree, institution, GPA, and relevant coursework. Highlight tech-related projects if they were significant or directly related to the job.
   - **Work Experience:** Focus exclusively on tech-related roles. Bullet points should be structured as: what you did, why you did it, and metrics that show your solution worked.
   - **Projects:** Include both coursework and side projects. Demonstrate your skills in various programming languages and technologies. Use technical terms and emphasize the impact and scale of your work.
   - **Skills:** List programming languages, frameworks, tools, and technologies. Be specific about your proficiency level (e.g., “Proficient in Python, Java; familiar with Rust, Go”).
   - **Certifications & Awards (optional):** Include any relevant certifications or recognition that support your technical expertise.

2. **Technical Terminology & Metrics:**
   - Use industry-specific buzzwords to pass through automated resume screening systems. Buzzwords like "machine learning," "big data," and "full stack" can be particularly impactful.
   - Include metrics to quantify your accomplishments (e.g., "Improved algorithm efficiency by 20%, reducing processing time from 5ms to 4ms").

3. **Action Words:**
   - Use strong, emphatic action verbs to describe your contributions (e.g., "architected," "engineered," "optimized"). These words add energy to your resume and make your achievements stand out.

4. **Formatting:**
   - Keep your resume to one page. If you don’t have enough technical material to fill one page, work on additional side projects to build your portfolio.
   - Use a clean, professional format with consistent spacing, fonts, and bullet points. Export your resume as a PDF to preserve formatting.

5. **Common Mistakes:**
   - Avoid listing non-tech accomplishments unless they’re directly relevant. For example, if you built a website for your hockey team, mention it; otherwise, leave it out.
   - Don’t exaggerate your skills—back them up with tangible evidence and clear metrics.
   - Proofread meticulously to avoid any spelling or grammar mistakes. A well-proofed resume reflects your attention to detail.

**Key Takeaway:**
Your resume is a tool to market yourself. It should reflect your technical expertise, problem-solving capabilities, and readiness to contribute to the tech industry. Make sure to use metrics to quantify your achievements and technical terms that resonate with recruiters, all while maintaining a clean and professional format.

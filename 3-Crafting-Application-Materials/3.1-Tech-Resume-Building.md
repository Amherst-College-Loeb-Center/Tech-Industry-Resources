Building a resume for the tech industry is about showcasing your technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and experience with technologies that align with the roles you’re applying for. Your resume is your first impression, and in a field where competition is fierce, it must stand out.

**Key Components:**

1. **Structure:**
   - **Header:** Include your name, contact information (phone number, email), and a link to your LinkedIn profile and GitHub repository. No need for a mailing address.

   - **Education:** List your degree, institution, GPA, and relevant coursework. Highlight projects if they were significant or directly related to the job.
   - **Work Experience:** Focus on tech-related roles. Each bullet should be structured as: what you did, why you did it, and metrics that show your solution worked.
   - **Projects:** Include both coursework and side projects. Demonstrate your skills in various programming languages and technologies. Use technical terms and emphasize the impact and scale of your work.
   - **Skills:** List programming languages, frameworks, tools, and technologies. Be specific about your proficiency level (e.g., “Proficient in Python, Java; familiar with Rust, Go”).
   - **Certifications & Awards (optional):** Include any relevant certifications or recognition.

2. **Technical Terminology & Metrics:**
   - Use industry-specific buzzwords to pass through automated resume screening systems.

3. **Action Words:**
   - Use strong, emphatic action verbs to describe your contributions (e.g., "architected," "engineered," "optimized").

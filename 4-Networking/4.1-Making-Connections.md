### 4.1 Making Connections

---

Building connections is crucial to success in the tech industry, especially when trying to secure internships or full-time roles. Networking isn't just about finding a job; it's about establishing relationships that can guide your career, provide mentorship, and open doors you didn't even know existed. The following subsections detail how to make and use connections in the tech world. In case you’re still wondering why you would need to network to succeed, [here](https://careers.amherst.edu/resources/networking-how-to-guide/) and [here](https://careers.amherst.edu/resources/informational-interviewing/) are some convincing Loeb Center resources. 

**1. Use LinkedIn Strategically**
LinkedIn is your gateway to the professional world. Here’s how to leverage it effectively:
- **Profile Setup:** Ensure your LinkedIn profile is polished, showcasing your skills, projects, and experiences. Use a professional photo, write a compelling headline, and craft a summary that tells your story.
- **Connections:** Start by connecting with peers, professors, and alumni from your college. Gradually expand to include professionals in your field of interest.
- **Engage:** Regularly post updates about your projects, share relevant articles, and comment on others’ posts. This keeps you visible in your network.

**2. Leveraging the Amherst Alumni Directory**
Amherst College has a robust alumni network. Here’s how to use it:
- **Search Techniques:** Use filters like company, industry, and graduation year in the [alumni directory](https://careers.amherst.edu/resources/using-the-alumni-directory/) to find alumni who work in the tech industry.
- **Cross-Referencing:** Sometimes, alumni profiles may not be up-to-date in the directory. Cross-reference with LinkedIn to ensure you have the most current information.
- **Email Outreach:** Once you’ve identified alumni, reach out via email. Introduce yourself, mention your shared Amherst connection, and express interest in learning about their career path. [Here](https://careers.amherst.edu/resources/connecting-with-alumni/) is a resource by Loeb center to further help you with the same.

  ```
  Subject: Amherst College Connection - Seeking Career Advice
  
  Dear [Alumnus Name],
  
  I hope this email finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I am a [Your Class Year] at Amherst College, majoring in [Your Major]. I came across your profile in the alumni directory and was inspired by your career trajectory at [Company Name].
  
  I am passionate about [Field of Interest] and am eager to learn more about the industry. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to chat with you about your experiences and any advice you might have for someone aspiring to enter this field.
  
  Thank you for your time, and I look forward to the possibility of connecting.
  
  Best regards,  
  [Your Name]
  ```

**3. Cold-Emailing: Making the First Move**
Cold-emailing can be daunting, but it’s an essential skill:
- **Personalization:** Always personalize your email. Mention specific aspects of the alumnus’s career that resonate with you.
- **Follow-Up:** If you don’t receive a response after a week, it’s appropriate to send a polite follow-up.

**4. Scheduling Informational Interviews**
Informational interviews are a powerful tool to learn about the industry and make a lasting impression.
- **Preparing for the Call:** Research the person’s role and company beforehand. Prepare thoughtful questions that go beyond what’s available online.
- **During the Call:** Be ready to introduce yourself, your main projects, and your motivations to work in tech in under a minute. Keep the conversation focused and professional. Express genuine interest in their insights.
- **Post-Call:** Always send a thank-you note within 24 hours, reiterating your appreciation and what you learned from the conversation.

**5. Networking Beyond Emails**
- **Attend Networking Events:** Participate in tech meetups, hackathons, and conferences. In-person meetings can be more impactful than virtual ones.
- **Utilize Social Media:** Engage with tech communities on Twitter, Reddit, and other platforms where industry professionals are active.

**6. Leveraging University Recruiters**
Certain Amherst alumni work as university recruiters. They can refer you to jobs and provide valuable insights on interview preparation and what the company is looking for in candidates. Don’t hesitate to reach out to them via LinkedIn or email. If you decide to do this, here is a good template to use: 

  ```
  Hi <xyz>!
  I found your profile while I was searching for <xyz company> Recruiters on LinkedIn. I am a Junior Computer Science major at Amherst College and <I created xyz project in Android that I then launched on the App Store. I have also coded an AI in TensorFlow that can translate Hindi.> I am interested in working at <xyz company> as a software engineering intern during summer 2018; can I send you my resume?
  Thanks!
  <name>.
  ```

Recruiter emails are hard to get if they’re not given to you, but you can get your hands on them by using a Gmail extension called ‘Clearbit Connect.’ CC predicts email addresses to a very high degree of accuracy; so if you find a recruiter’s name, you can use CC to generate her email address & send her your resume directly.

Direct messaging people on LinkedIn is generally not very effective. Recruiters rarely respond, alums are often too busy to do so and you might just end up wasting your time and LinkedIn credits.

**7. Building Long-Term Relationships**
Networking doesn’t end once you land a job. Maintain relationships by regularly checking in, sharing your progress, and offering your help when possible. Always follow up with a thank you note after any conversation or meeting.

**Key Takeaway:**
Networking is a continuous process that requires effort and authenticity. By strategically using tools like LinkedIn and the Amherst Alumni Directory, and by approaching networking as relationship-building rather than transactional exchanges, you can create a strong professional network that supports your career growth.

### 4.2 Hackathons and Career Fairs

---

Hackathons and career fairs are more than just events; they are opportunities to showcase your skills, meet potential employers, and expand your professional network. Here’s how to make the most out of these experiences.

**1. Preparing for Hackathons**
Hackathons are intense coding competitions where you solve problems or build projects in a limited time. Here’s how to prepare:
- **Select the Right Hackathon:** Choose hackathons that align with your interests. If you’re passionate about AI, look for AI-focused events.
- **Team Formation:** Whether you go solo or with a team, ensure you have a balanced skill set. A mix of front-end, back-end, and design skills can help create a well-rounded project.
- **Pre-Hackathon Preparation:** Familiarize yourself with the tools and technologies you plan to use. If the hackathon has a theme or challenge, brainstorm ideas ahead of time.

**2. During the Hackathon**
- **Time Management:** Break down tasks into manageable chunks and assign them to team members based on their strengths.
- **Stay Focused:** It’s easy to get sidetracked by perfectionism. Aim to create a working prototype rather than a polished product.
- **Presentation:** Practice your demo before presenting. Judges appreciate clarity and conciseness in your explanation.

**3. Networking at Hackathons**
Hackathons are excellent networking opportunities:
- **Engage with Sponsors:** Sponsors often provide mentors during the event. Engaging with them can lead to internships or job opportunities.
- **Connect with Participants:** Your fellow participants could be future collaborators or co-founders. Exchange contact information and stay in touch after the event.

**4. Making the Most of Career Fairs**
Career fairs can be overwhelming, but with the right approach, they can yield significant results:
- **Research Companies:** Before attending, research the companies that will be present. Tailor your resume and elevator pitch to align with their values and needs.
- **Prepare Your Elevator Pitch:** Your pitch should be a concise summary of who you are, what you do, and what you’re looking for.
- **Resume Tips:** Bring multiple copies of your resume. Ensure it highlights your most relevant skills and experiences.

**5. At the Career Fair**
- **First Impressions:** Dress professionally, smile, and offer a firm handshake. First impressions matter.
- **Ask Thoughtful Questions:** Demonstrate your interest in the company by asking insightful questions about their projects, culture, and future goals.
- **Follow-Up:** After the fair, send a follow-up email to the recruiters you spoke with, thanking them for their time and reiterating your interest in their company.

**6. Conferences and Special Events**
The Grace Hopper Conference is one such opportunity to meet people and find internships. Other conferences, like Start at a Startup, provide similar networking opportunities. The Greylock Techfair and Internapalooza are popular internship fairs in San Francisco. Moreover, virtually every growth-stage and established tech company hosts an Open House during the summer. Open Houses are designed to attract undergraduate students to employment opportunities at the specific company; paired with approachable recruiters, Open Houses provide amazing opportunities to gain insight into the company’s mission and success. Open Houses are normally by application, so it pays to be proactive in seeking them out.

**7. Leveraging Startups and Online Platforms**
Several startups like Jumpstart.me, stella.ai, and Nav Talent are in the business of intelligently matching undergraduate engineers to internships. Once you upload your resume to their portals, their Machine Learning models purport to match you to reputed company recruiters—this could be an effective way to get interviews.

**8. Campus Resources and Networking**
The Amherst CS Club often hosts workshops on programming techniques and languages that you could use to build your resume. The ‘Hackathon Hackers’ Facebook group is a great place to meet people who are hiring. SURF and other research experiences in CS may be a good resume builder even though they are not industry based experiences. The Loeb Center also hosts many tech companies throughout the year - Google, Facebook, LiveRamp, HubSpot, and Audible have all regularly made visits to campus to make focused connections with Amherst College students. A little-known fact is that if you attend a Google session on campus, their algorithm will recognize you when you apply for a position, and help sort your resume to the top of the pile. Completing your Handshake profile and indicating tech as an interest area ensures your account will alert you to employers coming to campus or other relevant events.

**9. Post-Hackathon and Career Fair**
- **Leverage Your Experience:** Update your LinkedIn and resume with your hackathon projects. Mention any awards or recognitions you received.
- **Continue Networking:** Stay connected with the people you met. Send LinkedIn invitations with personalized messages to remind them of your conversation.

**10. Participating in Virtual Events**
Virtual hackathons and career fairs have become more common. Here’s how to stand out:
- **Technical Setup:** Ensure you have a reliable internet connection, a quiet environment, and all necessary tools ready.
- **Engage Actively:** In virtual settings, engagement can be more challenging. Use chat functions, participate in Q&A sessions, and follow up promptly.

**Key Takeaway:**
Hackathons, career fairs, conferences, and Open Houses are invaluable experiences for anyone looking to break into the tech industry. By preparing thoroughly, engaging actively, and following up diligently, you can maximize the benefits of these events and propel your career forward. Taking advantage of both in-person and virtual opportunities, leveraging campus resources, and utilizing intelligent matchmaking platforms can significantly enhance your job search strategy and outcomes.

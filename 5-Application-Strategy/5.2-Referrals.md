### 5.2 Referrals

---

Referrals can be a game-changer in the competitive tech job market. A referral from someone within the company can push your application to the top of the pile and guarantee that your resume gets reviewed by a human. This guide will explore the strategies to effectively secure and utilize referrals.

#### Building Connections for Referrals
- **Networking with Alumni:** Leverage your college alumni network. Use tools like LinkedIn and the Amherst Alumni Directory to identify alumni working at your target companies.
- **Cold-emailing:** Once you’ve identified potential connections, reach out with a concise and respectful email. Mention any shared experiences or mutual connections and express your genuine interest in the company.
- **Attending Industry Events:** Conferences, hackathons, and tech talks are excellent opportunities to meet professionals in your field. Build relationships by engaging in meaningful conversations and follow up afterward.

#### Asking for Referrals
- **Timing:** Don’t ask for a referral immediately. Build a rapport first, whether through a series of emails, a phone call, or an informational interview.
- **Crafting the Ask:** When the time is right, be direct but polite in your request. Express why you are interested in the role and how your skills align with the company’s needs.
- **Provide Necessary Information:** Make it as easy as possible for the person to refer you by providing them with your resume, the job description, and a few bullet points on why you’re a good fit.

#### Maintaining Relationships
- **Follow-up:** After receiving a referral, send a thank-you note and keep the referrer updated on your progress. This shows professionalism and helps maintain the relationship for future opportunities.
- **Offering Value:** Whenever possible, offer something in return, whether it’s sharing resources, providing insights, or simply staying in touch.

**Key Takeaway:**
Referrals are more than just a shortcut to an interview; they are about building meaningful professional relationships. By strategically networking and maintaining these connections, you can significantly enhance your job search process.

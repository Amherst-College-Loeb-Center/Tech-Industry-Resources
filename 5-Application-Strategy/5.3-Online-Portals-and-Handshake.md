### 5.3 Online Portals and Handshake

---

Online portals, including company career sites and Handshake, are the most common way to submit job applications. However, applying through these portals often feels like sending your resume into a black hole. This section will discuss how to optimize your applications through these platforms and navigate the application process effectively.

#### Understanding Online Portals
- **Company Career Sites:** These portals are the official gateway for job applications. They often include detailed job descriptions, requirements, and occasionally, direct links to specific hiring managers or recruiters.
- **Application Tracking Systems (ATS):** Most online portals use ATS to screen applications. Understanding how these systems work can help you tailor your resume to pass the initial screening.

#### Optimizing Your Applications
- **Keyword Optimization:** Tailor your resume and cover letter to include keywords from the job description. This increases the likelihood of your application passing through the ATS.
- **Completing All Fields:** Fill out all optional fields in the application. This demonstrates thoroughness and can sometimes be the deciding factor in passing the ATS filter. Additionally, after uploading your resume and cover letter and inputting basic personal information, you will often be asked some additional optional questions regarding race, citizenship status, military service, disabilities, and gender. Fill these carefully and honestly. If you’re an international student, declare that you will need future sponsorship. Lying on these forms is not only unethical but can have severe consequences, including being caught during a background check, which can endanger your career.

#### Using Handshake Effectively
- **Profile Completeness:** Ensure your Handshake profile is fully completed and up-to-date. This allows the platform to match you with relevant opportunities and makes you more visible to recruiters.
- **Favoriting Employers:** Use Handshake’s features to “favorite” companies you’re interested in. This way, you’ll receive notifications when they post new positions.
- **Applying Early:** Applications submitted early in the cycle are often reviewed more thoroughly. Set alerts for new postings to stay ahead of the competition.

#### Direct Applications and Referrals
- **Direct Applications vs. Portals:** Whenever possible, combine your portal application with a direct email to a recruiter or a referral from an employee. This increases the chances of your application being noticed. After submitting your application, it’s crucial to follow up with your referrer. This ensures that your application is flagged and considered by the hiring team. In some cases, companies may prefer that you send your application materials directly to your referrer instead of applying online, so always clarify the process with your contact.

#### Tracking Your Applications
- **Spreadsheet Tracker:** Keep a spreadsheet of all the jobs you’ve applied for, including the date, company, job title, and any follow-up actions. This helps you stay organized and ensures timely follow-ups.
- **Follow-up Strategy:** After applying, follow up with a polite email to the recruiter or your connection within the company. This reinforces your interest and keeps your application top of mind.

**Key Takeaways:**
While online portals are an essential part of the job application process, they should be used strategically. By optimizing your materials, completing all fields honestly, and supplementing your applications with direct outreach, you can significantly increase your chances of success. Always follow up with any referrals and keep track of your applications to maintain a proactive approach in your job search.

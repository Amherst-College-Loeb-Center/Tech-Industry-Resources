### 1.2 Importance of Preparation

---

Recruiting in the tech industry follows a structured cycle that serves three primary purposes:
1. **Connecting Candidates with Recruiters**: Companies seek out talented individuals from schools across the country, often starting the recruitment process in mid-summer to early fall. 
2. **Channeling Candidates Through Interviews**: Candidates are filtered through a series of technical and behavioral interviews to assess their suitability for internships or full-time positions.
3. **Maintaining Relationships for Future Recruitment**: Even if you donâ€™t land a position immediately, recruiters may keep you in mind for future opportunities.

#### Timeline

The recruiting process typically begins with online application portals opening in mid-summer. Banks and financial firms that offer engineering internships are usually the first to start accepting applications, often in early July. The bulk of other companies follow suit by October, with most interviews wrapped up by February. It's crucial to apply early in the cycle to increase your chances of getting noticed.

#### Popular Companies

The most sought-after employers in the tech industry are the Big 5: Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple. These companies are known for their rigorous selection processes but also for offering some of the most prestigious and well-compensated roles. Other prominent firms include Salesforce, Cisco, Oracle, and Intuit, as well as fast-growing startups and subsidiaries like Airbnb, Uber, and Palantir.

#### Available Positions

Tech roles generally fall into three broad categories:
1. **Engineering**: Front-end, back-end, full-stack, data science, and iOS/Android development.
2. **Product Management**: Involves a mix of coding and project development skills.
3. **UI/UX Design/Research**: Focuses on user experience and interface design.

#### Popular Locations

While Silicon Valley remains the epicenter of the tech industry, other hubs like Seattle, New York, Boston, and Austin are rapidly growing in prominence. Companies with significant tech operations can be found across the U.S., making tech careers geographically diverse.

### 1.3 Initial Steps

---

Most online applications will ask for a resume, a cover letter and some information about your work eligibility. The resumes are expected to be tailored to the tech industry, the cover letters are expected to be well-researched and all information provided is expected to be truthful. It’s better to tell the truth because even if you lie and get the job, background verification will catch you. The easiest way to get rejected is to apply online on a company site. Instead, you should ask a contact who already works at the company to refer you for the position you would like to be considered for. More on this later. In addition to these documents, it is recommended to set up a descriptive LinkedIn page and maintain a Github for all your code. A personal website, if you are able to create one, would also be helpful for recruiters. 

Applying for a tech job through [Handshake](https://amherst.joinhandshake.com/login), however, is worth your time. Handshake is the Loeb Center’s career management platform, and fields postings from companies who have specifically selected Amherst as one of their recruiting targets. Those companies will then track the pipelines of applicants coming in through the Handshake process and consider them separately than those coming in through their main company website.

Applying is a tumultuous process and it’s extremely repetitive. Researching and shortlisting companies, updating and re-sending your resume, writing cover letters and ultimately, interviewing for multiple rounds for multiple companies is monotonous. Nonetheless, successful applicants spend the summer preparing for this process in multiple different ways. The goal of this section is to tell you what you should be working on throughout the summer to put yourself in the best possible position for an internship/job the next summer.

#### Complete Your Handshake Profile

One of the easiest first steps you can take, to make sure you don’t miss any Amherst-specific recruiting or networking opportunities, is to complete a robust profile in [Handshake](https://amherst.joinhandshake.com/login). The more complete your profile, the more tailored the platform can work for you. For instance, if you “favorite” target tech employers in Handshake, you can receive and email ping when that company posts a new position. Furthermore, recruiters search out undergraduate candidates across schools, across the entire platform, using search criteria based on profile data. So help the system help you by creating as detailed a profile as possible. 

#### Build Your Resume

Your resume is your first impression on potential employers. It should highlight your passion for technology, coding experience, and any relevant projects or internships. Use technical terms and metrics to quantify your achievements, and make sure your resume is tailored to the tech industry. Keep your resume concise and focused on computer science-related accomplishments.

#### Draft a Cover Letter

While cover letters are less critical in tech than in other industries, they still offer a chance to demonstrate your interest in a particular company. Tailor each cover letter to the specific company you are applying to, highlighting your understanding of their products and values.

#### Make a LinkedIn Profile

LinkedIn is an invaluable tool for networking and job searching in the tech industry. Ensure your profile is up-to-date, with a strong summary of your skills and experiences. Use LinkedIn to connect with Amherst alumni and other professionals in your target companies. Feel free to use [mine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhyey-mavani/) as a point of reference.

#### Make a GitHub and Personal Website

A GitHub profile showcasing your coding projects can significantly boost your employability. It's where recruiters can see the quality of your code and the breadth of your technical skills. If you have the time, consider creating a personal website to centralize your online presence, including links to your LinkedIn, GitHub, and resume.

#### Go to Hackathons, Career Fairs, and Talks

Participating in hackathons and attending career fairs or talks are excellent ways to network and learn new technologies. These events can lead directly to job opportunities or at least help you build connections with recruiters and industry professionals.

These detailed steps provide a solid foundation as you start your journey toward a career in the tech industry. By preparing your materials and taking proactive steps to connect with potential employers, you'll be well-positioned to navigate the competitive recruiting process.

#### Preparing Your Application Materials

Before diving into the job application process, it's essential to prepare your materials thoroughly. This involves not only crafting a strong resume and cover letter but also building a robust online presence.

#### Complete Your Handshake Profile

One of the easiest initial steps is to complete your Handshake profile. This platform is tailored to connect Amherst students with employers who have specifically targeted the college for recruitment. A complete profile helps you receive tailored job alerts and ensures that recruiters can find you easily when searching for candidates.

#### Build Your Resume

Your resume is your first impression on potential employers. It should highlight your passion for technology, coding experience, and any relevant projects or internships. Use technical terms and metrics to quantify your achievements, and make sure your resume is tailored to the tech industry. Keep your resume concise and focused on computer science-related accomplishments.

#### Draft a Cover Letter

While cover letters are less critical in tech than in other industries, they still offer a chance to demonstrate your interest in a particular company. Tailor each cover letter to the specific company you are applying to, highlighting your understanding of their products and values.

#### Make a LinkedIn Profile

LinkedIn is an invaluable tool for networking and job searching in the tech industry. Ensure your profile is up-to-date, with a strong summary of your skills and experiences. Use LinkedIn to connect with Amherst alumni and other professionals in your target companies.

#### Make a GitHub and Personal Website

A GitHub profile showcasing your coding projects can significantly boost your employability. It's where recruiters can see the quality of your code and the breadth of your technical skills. If you have the time, consider creating a personal website to centralize your online presence, including links to your LinkedIn, GitHub, and resume.

#### Go to Hackathons, Career Fairs, and Talks

Participating in hackathons and attending career fairs or talks are excellent ways to network and learn new technologies. These events can lead directly to job opportunities or at least help you build connections with recruiters and industry professionals.

These detailed steps provide a solid foundation as you start your journey toward a career in the tech industry. By preparing your materials and taking proactive steps to connect with potential employers, you'll be well-positioned to navigate the competitive recruiting process.

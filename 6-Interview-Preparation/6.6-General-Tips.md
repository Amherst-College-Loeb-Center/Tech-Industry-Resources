#### 6.6 General Tips for the Process

##### Start Early

**Start now.** You can’t afford to wait another month before beginning the process, as delaying makes it harder to secure an offer and pushes back your timeline. The earlier you get started, the higher your priority on the company's candidate list, and the more likely you are to land an interview. Begin reaching out to people, preparing your resume, starting side projects, and revising your data structures to get ahead of the game.

##### Don’t Memorize Solutions

It’s not worth the effort. Memorizing solutions takes too much time with very little payoff, and you’re extremely unlikely to encounter the exact same problem. Instead, focus on understanding concepts and problem-solving strategies.

##### Encountering an Interview Problem You’ve Done Before

What if you’re asked a problem that you’ve encountered before, either in a previous interview or during practice? Should you confess, or should you solve it flawlessly? This is a tricky question with divisive answers.

- **Honesty Approach:** Some believe it’s best to be honest, telling the interviewer that you’ve solved the problem before. This approach shows integrity and honesty. Even if you solve the problem effortlessly, the interviewer might suspect you’ve encountered it before.

- **Preparedness Approach:** Others argue that encountering a problem you’ve solved before is a testament to your preparation. You’ve earned the right to keep quiet because you’ve studied hard. 

There’s no consensus here, but the former approach is generally seen as more honorable. However, if you encounter a *similar* problem (not the exact one), it’s perfectly fine to solve it – that’s an essential problem-solving strategy.

##### Don’t Panic if You See a Hard Question

Breathe. You’ve put in the work – trust your mind to come up with a solution. Follow the routine: work through an example, use problem-solving strategies, and you’ll likely find an algorithm that works.

##### Practice Interviewing with Other People

Interviewing, like any skill, improves with practice. Connect with peers or others in the industry and schedule mock interviews with each other. Provide feedback and learn from each other – often, hearing how others perceive your performance can dispel false notions you may have about yourself. Online platforms like Pramp can also help simulate coding interviews with peers.

##### Schedule Interviews When You’re at Your Best

I’m a morning person, so I scheduled all my interviews early in the day. Your performance is what matters most, so choose a time when you’re at your peak. Ensure you have a decent block of time (around 2 hours) and pick a day/time when you’re not too stressed with other commitments. Always choose a quiet place to interview – silence is crucial for concentration, and the interviewer doesn’t want to hear background noise.

##### Unconventional Internship Opportunities

While most internship programs, like those offered by the Big 5, target Juniors in college, there are opportunities for Freshmen and Sophomores too. Programs like Microsoft Explore and Google Engineering Practicum are great examples. Additionally, some companies have diversity-based recruiting programs, which can be a huge advantage if you qualify. Research these opportunities early to maximize your chances.

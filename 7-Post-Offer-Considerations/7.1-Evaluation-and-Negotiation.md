### 7.1 Evaluation and Negotiation

---

Congratulations on receiving an offer! However, the process isn't over yet. Before accepting, it's crucial to evaluate the offer thoroughly and consider negotiation. Here's how to navigate this phase:

#### **1. Evaluating the Offer**
- **Salary and Compensation:** Research industry standards for similar roles in your location. Use resources like Glassdoor, Payscale, and the Amherst Alumni network to gauge whether the offer aligns with industry norms. Remember to consider both the base salary and additional compensation like bonuses, stock options, and other perks.
- **Benefits Package:** Evaluate health insurance, retirement plans, vacation days, and other benefits like tuition reimbursement or professional development funds. Sometimes, a lower salary might be offset by exceptional benefits.
- **Work-Life Balance:** Consider the company culture regarding work hours, remote work options, and work-life balance. The "Landing a Gig in the Tech World" guide emphasizes the importance of understanding company culture, which directly impacts work-life balance.
- **Career Growth Opportunities:** Assess opportunities for career advancement, mentorship, and professional development. Is there a clear path for progression? Will the company invest in your skills and growth?
- **Company Stability and Values:** Look at the company’s financial health, growth trajectory, and alignment with your values. This can be particularly important if you're joining a startup or a smaller company.

#### **2. Deciding to Negotiate**
- **When to Negotiate:** You should consider negotiating if the offer doesn’t meet your expectations or industry standards. Evaluate the entire compensation package, not just the salary.
- **What to Negotiate:**
  - **Salary:** If your research shows that the salary is below industry standards, consider negotiating for a higher base salary.
  - **Signing Bonus:** Especially in tech, signing bonuses are common and can be a point of negotiation.
  - **Equity:** If joining a startup, consider negotiating equity, which can be significant in the long run.
  - **Relocation Assistance:** If you're moving for the job, ensure that the relocation package covers your needs.
  - **Work Schedule and Remote Work:** In the post-pandemic era, flexible work arrangements can be negotiable.
  - **Professional Development:** Negotiate for conference attendance, further education, or certifications that the company will fund.

#### **3. How to Negotiate**
- **Be Prepared:** Arm yourself with data about industry standards and your worth. Use websites like Glassdoor, Payscale, and others mentioned in the "Landing a Gig in the Tech World" guide.
- **Communicate Clearly:** Approach the negotiation with a positive attitude. Express your excitement about the offer and the company but state that you’d like to discuss a few aspects of the offer.
- **Be Reasonable:** Be realistic in your expectations. Consider the company’s size, financial health, and the competitiveness of the job market.
- **Practice Makes Perfect:** Practice your negotiation conversation with a mentor or trusted colleague to ensure you are confident and articulate during the actual negotiation.
- **Get it in Writing:** Ensure that any changes to the offer are documented in writing before you accept.

#### **4. Making a Decision**
- **Consider Your Priorities:** Reflect on what’s most important to you—be it salary, benefits, work-life balance, or growth opportunities—and make your decision based on that.
- **Seek Advice:** Consult with trusted mentors, friends, or career advisors who can provide an objective perspective.
- **Trust Your Instincts:** Finally, go with your gut. If something doesn’t feel right, it’s okay to turn down the offer.

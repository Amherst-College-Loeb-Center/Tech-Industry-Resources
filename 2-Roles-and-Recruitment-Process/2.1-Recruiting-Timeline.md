### 2.1 Recruiting Timeline

---

Understanding the recruiting timeline is crucial for navigating the tech job market successfully. The timeline for applying to tech roles can vary depending on the company and the type of role you're targeting. However, most tech recruiting follows a general pattern:

- **Early Summer (June - July):**  
  - **Investment Banks & Early Recruiters:** Banks like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and other financial institutions offering engineering internships often start accepting applications as early as July.
  - **Preparation:** This is the time to start preparing your resume, building connections, and applying for early programs if you're targeting roles that require a high level of preparedness.

- **Late Summer (August - September):**  
  - **Tech Giants & Medium-sized Companies:** Major companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft usually open their applications during this period. Medium-sized companies and startups also start posting roles around this time.
  - **Online Coding Challenges & Interviews:** Some companies might send out online coding challenges shortly after the application window opens. Be ready to tackle these as soon as they come.

- **Fall (October - November):**  
  - **Last Wave of Applications:** Smaller startups and some late recruiters might still be accepting applications. It's also the period when most interviews take place.
  - **On-Site Interviews:** For those who have progressed through initial rounds, on-site interviews or final rounds are often scheduled during this time.

- **Winter (December - January):**  
  - **Decision Time:** Companies usually finalize their decisions and send out offers during this period. Some companies may extend offers earlier, depending on their timeline.

- **Spring (February - March):**  
  - **Offer Acceptance & Onboarding:** Candidates are expected to accept offers and begin the onboarding process. It's also the time to prepare for internships or full-time roles that start in the summer.

- **Tips:**
  - **Apply Early:** Applying early increases your chances of getting noticed before the applicant pool becomes saturated.
  - **Networking:** Leverage alumni connections and networking events to get referrals, which can significantly boost your application.
